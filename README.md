# Google Developer Student Club Website - ENSAM Rabat

Welcome to the Google Developer Student Club Website repository! This is a collaborative project developed by students in the GDSC ENSAM Rabat. 

Our goal is to build a web app for our club that serves as a platform for students to showcase their technical skills and creativity.

This is our existing website but for now it's only a bio profile hosted by beacons.ai:
